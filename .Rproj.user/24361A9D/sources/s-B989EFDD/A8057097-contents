## Appendix B - Control Chart Special Cause Rules (Nelson Rules)
These are rules that check for Outliers, Trends, Shifts, Cycles, and changes in stability. This is what drives the colouring of the points in the charts. We chose to use the Nelson rules as they are akin to best practice at this time. *We have used 3/3 and 5/5 for rules 5 and 6*.

- Rule 1: 1 point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.(Outliers)
- Rule 2: 9+ points in a row are on the same side of the mean. (Shift)
- Rule 3: 6+ points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing). (Trends)
- Rule 4: 14+ points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing (Cycles)
- Rule 5: 2+ out of 3 consecutive points are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction (Shift)
- Rule 6: 4+ out of 5 consecutive points are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction (Shift)
- Rule 7: 15+ points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean (Increased Stability) 
- Rule 8: 8+ consecutive points with none within 1 standard deviation of the mean and the points are in both directions from the mean (Decreased Stability)

Rules 7 and 8 are require proper tuning. Their goal is to identify when we have consistent performance around the center line. If there has been a shift, but we haven't recalibrated they will give confusing bad messages.

```{r AppendixLog, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, include=FALSE}

#set the log file name
logFileName <- paste0(wd,"/SPC Logs/", params$reportType, "/Historical Special Causes ",format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%B-%d"),".csv")

#extract the appendix messages and combine them into a data table
z <-genAppendixLog(list_Charts_MSGs)

if( is.not.null(z)){
  write.csv(x=z,file=logFileName) #save the log file as a csv
}

## Appendix C - Historical Special Cause Notifications
Full historical special cause notifications can be found in '`r logFileName`'.

## Appendix D - Technical Details

#### Metrics where people can move between programs.
For some metrics people can move between programs, which triggers special cause detection. Current inpatient Days >30 is one example. There is a large spike in Home & Community Care in 2017/18 because a LLOS patient went from Medicine to Paliative Care. When programs have large volumes like Medicine this doesn't matter so much, but for smaller programs like Paliative Care it causes large distortions. Don't take programs with small volumes too seriously for these types of metrics.

#### We did compute the type 1 error rate of the report

Please contact Decision Support for the technical details if you desire them.
